//! What a Sender and a Receiver are each doing, in the project's own words.
//!
//! IS-04 says `active` at both ends. That word stops here. A Sender that is
//! putting its Flow on the network and a Receiver that is taking a stream are
//! different facts, and neither of them means "connected" — only a *pair* is
//! connected, and answering that needs every Node, which is the engine's job,
//! not this crate's. See `docs/adr/0004-connection-vocabulary-and-graph.md`.
