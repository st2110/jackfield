//! The IS-05 Connection API client: reads transport parameters, and nothing else.
//!
//! Two things this client deliberately does not do.
//!
//! It does not report connection state. That already came from the resource
//! tree at six requests per Node, and reading it again here would cost one
//! request per resource for an answer we have — see
//! `docs/adr/0005-two-tier-fetch.md`.
//!
//! It does not write. There is no `staged` PATCH and no activation anywhere in
//! this crate, and `tests/read_only.rs` asserts it, because a controller that
//! could accidentally reconfigure equipment that is on air is not one anybody
//! should run.
