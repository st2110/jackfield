# Vendored AMWA schemas

These files are copied byte-for-byte from the AMWA specification repositories.
They are the contract this project is checked against: the test suite validates
every resource the controller parses, and everything it serializes, against
them. See `docs/adr/0001-nmos-types-by-hand-schemas-as-validators.md` for why
they are validators rather than a source of generated types, and
`docs/adr/0002-...` for what is not vendored.

Nothing here is edited. A change to the contract is a re-vendor at a new tag,
recorded by updating this file.

## AMWA IS-04 — Discovery and Registration

| | |
|---|---|
| Repository | <https://github.com/AMWA-TV/is-04> |
| Tag | `v1.3.3` |
| Commit | `8e6876d9067cc56f9eca5345d44e41d9e1754444` |
| Vendored on | 2026-09-04 |

- `is-04/v1.3/` — the complete contents of `APIs/schemas/`.
- `examples/is-04/` — the `examples/nodeapi-*.json` documents. Only the Node API
  is consumed; the Registration and Query API examples are deliberately absent,
  because this project speaks peer-to-peer and has no registry client.

## AMWA IS-05 — Device Connection Management

| | |
|---|---|
| Repository | <https://github.com/AMWA-TV/is-05> |
| Tag | `v1.1.2` |
| Commit | `325dc5c7d99716c58caa6c00cee4d69cede0e65c` |
| Vendored on | 2026-09-04 |

- `is-05/v1.1/` — the complete contents of `APIs/schemas/`.
- `examples/is-05/` — the `active` responses for Senders and Receivers, and the
  `single` root. The `stage` and `bulk` examples are absent because this project
  never writes to a device.
